# Financial Data Analysis and Investment Strategy Assistant  

## Overview  
This project is an AI-driven solution for analyzing financial market data, predicting market trends, and providing actionable investment strategies. It incorporates machine learning models to classify market conditions and an AI chatbot powered by the [FINGU-AI/FinguAI-Chat-v1](https://huggingface.co/FINGU-AI/FinguAI-Chat-v1) to offer interactive financial advice. Designed as a Google Colab notebook, this project requires no installationsâ€”just click the link, and you're ready to explore.

## Features  
- **Financial Market Classification**:  
   - Utilizes machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Neural Network Classifier) to classify market conditions based on historical data.  
   - Evaluates models using key metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis.  
   - Identifies the best-performing model to predict potential market crashes or growth.  

- **Investment Strategy Generator**:  
   - Based on market predictions, provides actionable investment advice:  
     - *Crash predicted*: Minimize losses using hedging strategies or safe-haven assets.  
     - *No crash predicted*: Maximize returns with high-growth or diversified investments.  

- **Interactive AI Chatbot**:  
   - Powered by the [FINGU-AI/FinguAI-Chat-v1](https://huggingface.co/FINGU-AI/FinguAI-Chat-v1), this chatbot provides personalized financial insights.  
   - User-friendly conversational interface for exploring investment opportunities and market predictions.

   [**Open Financial Data Analysis Project in Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
   *(Replace this placeholder link with your actual Colab link.)*  

2. **Upload Your Financial Dataset**:  
   - Ensure your dataset (e.g., `sp500_trends.csv`) is available in your Google Drive.  
   - Update the `data_path` in the notebook to point to your dataset file.  

3. **Run the Notebook**:  
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train models, evaluate performance, and interact with the AI chatbot.  

4. **Interact with the Chatbot**:  
   - Enter financial or investment-related queries in the chatbot prompt to receive expert advice.

## Key Components  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handles missing values, categorical features, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for machine learning.  
- Encodes target labels and performs a train-test split for robust model evaluation.  

### 2. Machine Learning Models  
- **Logistic Regression**: Lightweight and interpretable.  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Robust and suitable for handling large feature sets.  
- **Neural Network Classifier**: Captures complex patterns in data with high accuracy.  

### 3. Metrics and Evaluation  
- Metrics include:  
   - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.  
   - **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall for imbalanced data.  
   - **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives.  
   - **Recall**: Proportion of true positives among actual positives.  
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of true/false positives and negatives.  

### 4. Investment Strategy Generator  
- Generates actionable investment strategies based on model predictions (e.g., minimize losses during a crash, maximize growth during favorable conditions).  

### 5. AI Chatbot Integration  
- Powered by [FINGU-AI/FinguAI-Chat-v1](https://huggingface.co/FINGU-AI/FinguAI-Chat-v1), the chatbot leverages a conversational AI model to simulate a financial advisor.  
- Includes support for user-defined prompts and advanced NLP features.

## Example Outputs  

### Market Trend Prediction  
- **Best Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy**: 85.32%  
- **F1 Score**: 0.84  
- **Example Investment Strategy**: "Maximize returns: Consider high-growth stocks or diversified investments."  

### Chatbot Interaction  
- **User Prompt**: "How should I invest during a volatile market?"  
- **Chatbot Response**: "During volatility, consider minimizing risks by investing in bond ETFs, low-volatility funds, or safe-haven assets like gold."
